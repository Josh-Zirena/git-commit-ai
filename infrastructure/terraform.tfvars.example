# Terraform Variables Configuration Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values

# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
environment = "production"
project_name = "git-commit-ai"

# Network Configuration
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
public_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]

# EC2 Configuration
instance_type = "t3.micro"
root_volume_size = 20
root_volume_type = "gp3"

# REQUIRED: SSH Key Configuration
# Generate a key pair: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/git-commit-ai-key
# Then paste the public key content here (from ~/.ssh/git-commit-ai-key.pub)
public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA... your-ssh-public-key-here"

# Security Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Restrict SSH access to your IP for security
# Get your IP: curl ifconfig.me
# Replace with your actual IP address
allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE/32"]

# Domain Configuration (Optional)
# If you have a domain managed by Route53, uncomment and configure:
# domain_name = "your-domain.com"

# Application Configuration
app_port = 3000
health_check_path = "/health"
health_check_interval = 30
health_check_timeout = 5
healthy_threshold = 2
unhealthy_threshold = 3

# Example configurations for different environments:

# Development Environment
# aws_region = "us-west-2"
# environment = "development"
# instance_type = "t3.nano"
# root_volume_size = 10
# allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Less secure - only for development

# Production Environment
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# environment = "production"
# instance_type = "t3.small"
# root_volume_size = 30
# allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["203.0.113.0/24"]  # Your office IP range
# domain_name = "your-domain.com"

# Notes:
# 1. Always restrict SSH access to specific IP ranges in production
# 2. Use a strong SSH key pair for EC2 access
# 3. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure access
# 4. Monitor costs - estimated monthly cost is $8-12 for t3.micro setup
# 5. SSL certificate requires a domain managed by Route53
# 6. All resources are tagged with Environment and Project for organization
