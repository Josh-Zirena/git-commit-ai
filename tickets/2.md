## Ticket 2: Input Validation Utilities

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

### Description

Create utilities to validate git diff input to ensure the API only processes valid git diffs and prevents malicious input.

### Requirements

- Create a validation utility module that checks if input looks like a valid git diff
- Validate presence of common git diff indicators (diff --git, +++, ---, @@, +/- lines)
- Handle edge cases like empty input, very large diffs, or malformed text
- Provide clear validation error messages
- Make validation functions pure and testable

### Files to Create

- `src/utils/validation.ts` with git diff validation functions
- `test/utils/validation.test.ts` with comprehensive test coverage

### Testing Requirements

- Test validation with valid git diff examples (various formats)
- Test validation with invalid inputs (random text, empty strings, malformed diffs)
- Test edge cases like very large diffs, binary file diffs, and unusual diff formats
- Test that validation functions are pure (no side effects)
- Achieve 100% test coverage for validation functions

### Acceptance Criteria

- Validation correctly identifies valid git diffs
- Validation rejects invalid or malicious input
- All edge cases are handled gracefully
- Functions are pure and have no side effects
- Test coverage is 100%
