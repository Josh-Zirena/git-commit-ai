## Ticket 7: Production Application Features

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

### Description

Add production-ready application features including health monitoring, structured logging, graceful shutdown, and security hardening.

### Requirements

- Add health check endpoint that returns application status and dependencies
- Implement structured logging middleware with configurable log levels (info, warn, error)
- Add graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
- Add security headers middleware (helmet.js or custom)
- Add basic application metrics endpoint (uptime, memory usage, request counts)
- Add request ID tracking for distributed tracing
- Configure environment-specific logging (console for dev, file for production)

### Files to Create

- `src/routes/health.ts` - Health check endpoint with dependency checks
- `src/middleware/logging.ts` - Structured logging middleware with request IDs
- `src/middleware/security.ts` - Security headers middleware
- `src/middleware/metrics.ts` - Basic application metrics collection
- `src/utils/graceful-shutdown.ts` - Graceful shutdown handler
- `src/config/logging.ts` - Logging configuration

### Testing Requirements

- Test health check endpoint returns 200 with proper JSON structure
- Test health check returns 503 when dependencies are down
- Test logging middleware captures request/response data
- Test graceful shutdown closes connections cleanly
- Test security headers are present in responses
- Test metrics endpoint returns proper JSON structure

### Acceptance Criteria

- Health check endpoint at `/health` returns `{status: "healthy", uptime: number, timestamp: string}`
- All HTTP requests are logged with request ID, method, path, status, duration
- Application handles SIGTERM/SIGINT and closes server gracefully within 30 seconds
- Security headers include: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection
- Metrics endpoint at `/metrics` returns basic app stats
- All logging uses consistent JSON format in production
