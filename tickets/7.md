## Ticket 7: Production Readiness and Deployment

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Description

Add production-ready features like health checks, logging, and prepare the application for EC2 deployment with proper process management.

### Requirements

- Add health check endpoint for monitoring
- Implement structured logging with different log levels
- Add graceful shutdown handling
- Create production-ready start scripts
- Add basic monitoring and metrics
- Prepare EC2 deployment scripts or instructions
- Add security headers and basic hardening

### Files to Create

- `src/middleware/logging.ts` with logging middleware
- `src/routes/health.ts` with health check endpoint
- `scripts/deploy.sh` with deployment automation
- `ecosystem.config.js` for PM2 process management (optional)

### Testing Requirements

- Test health check endpoint responds correctly
- Test logging middleware captures requests
- Test graceful shutdown behavior
- Test deployment process on EC2 instance
- Verify security headers are properly set

### Acceptance Criteria

- Health check endpoint returns proper status
- Logging captures all important events
- Application shuts down gracefully
