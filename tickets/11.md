## **Ticket 11: Internal Infrastructure & Monitoring**

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

### **Description**

Create internal infrastructure for operational endpoints like `/metrics` and `/health` with proper network isolation, comprehensive monitoring, and security controls separate from public-facing services.

### **Requirements**

- Create private subnets across 2 availability zones for internal services
- Deploy internal Application Load Balancer accessible only within VPC
- Configure security groups restricting internal traffic to VPC CIDR blocks only
- Set up NAT Gateway for private subnet outbound internet access
- Configure separate target groups for internal operational endpoints
- Add comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring with custom metrics and alarms
- Create CloudWatch dashboard for application and infrastructure monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch log groups for application and system logs
- Configure SNS topics for alarm notifications
- Implement VPC Flow Logs for network traffic monitoring

### **Files to Create**

- `infrastructure/internal-network.tf` - Private subnets, NAT gateway, routing tables
- `infrastructure/internal-alb.tf` - Internal load balancer and target group configuration
- `infrastructure/internal-security-groups.tf` - Internal traffic security rules
- `infrastructure/monitoring.tf` - CloudWatch alarms, dashboards, and log groups
- `infrastructure/sns.tf` - SNS topics and subscriptions for notifications
- `infrastructure/vpc-flow-logs.tf` - VPC Flow Logs configuration
- `infrastructure/internal-variables.tf` - Variables specific to internal infrastructure
- `scripts/configure-internal-routing.sh` - Script to configure application internal routing

### **Infrastructure Specifications**

- **Private Subnets:** Separate CIDR blocks in each availability zone
- **NAT Gateway:** Single NAT Gateway for cost optimization with high availability option
- **Internal ALB:** Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer for internal traffic only
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive CloudWatch setup with custom application metrics
- **Logging:** Centralized logging with proper retention policies
- **Alerting:** Multi-tier alerting strategy with appropriate escalation

### **Security Configuration**

- Internal ALB security group allows traffic only from VPC CIDR ranges
- EC2 internal security group allows internal port access from internal ALB only
- Private subnets have no direct internet access (outbound only via NAT)
- VPC Flow Logs capture all network traffic for security analysis
- Internal endpoints blocked from public internet access
- Network ACLs provide additional layer of security for private subnets

### **Monitoring and Alerting Setup**

- CloudWatch alarms for CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
- Application-specific alarms for response time and error rates
- Health check alarms for both public and internal endpoints
- SNS notifications for critical alerts with email and/or SMS
- CloudWatch dashboard with key performance indicators
- Log aggregation for application logs, system logs, and access logs
- Metric filters for error detection and performance monitoring

### **Application Configuration Requirements**

- Application must expose internal endpoints on separate port (9090)
- Internal endpoints include: `/metrics`, `/health`, `/admin/status`
- Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint for monitoring integration
- Health check endpoint with detailed service status
- Internal endpoints must bind to all interfaces for ALB access

### **Testing Requirements**

- Internal ALB accessible only from within VPC (test from bastion or EC2)
- Public access to `/metrics` and internal endpoints returns 403 or timeout
- Internal endpoints accessible via internal ALB and return 200 status
- CloudWatch alarms trigger correctly with simulated test conditions
- NAT Gateway provides outbound internet access for private subnet resources
- VPC Flow Logs capture and store network traffic data
- SNS notifications deliver to configured endpoints during alarm states
- All internal traffic properly logged and monitored

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Internal endpoints return 403/timeout when accessed via public ALB
- [ ] Internal endpoints return 200 when accessed via internal ALB from VPC
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboard displays comprehensive application and infrastructure metrics
- [ ] All critical CloudWatch alarms configured and tested with notifications
- [ ] Private subnets have outbound internet access via NAT Gateway
- [ ] Internal ALB health checks pass consistently for all targets
- [ ] Security groups prevent unauthorized access to internal services
- [ ] VPC Flow Logs enabled and capturing network traffic
- [ ] Monthly cost increase under $10 for internal infrastructure
- [ ] SNS notifications working for critical alerts
