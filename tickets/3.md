## Ticket 3: OpenAI Service Integration

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### Description

Create the OpenAI service module that takes git diffs and generates meaningful commit messages using GPT-4o-mini with carefully crafted prompts.

### Requirements

- Create OpenAI service module with proper API client initialization
- Implement function to generate commit messages from git diffs
- Use GPT-4o-mini model with optimized settings (low temperature, appropriate max tokens)
- Create prompt engineering for conventional commit format
- Parse AI responses to extract clean commit messages and descriptions
- Handle OpenAI API errors and rate limits gracefully
- Return structured response with commit message, description, and usage data

### Files to Create

- `src/services/openai.ts` with OpenAI service functions
- `test/services/openai.test.ts` with comprehensive test coverage

### Testing Requirements

- Mock OpenAI API calls to avoid actual API usage during tests
- Test successful commit message generation with various diff types
- Test error handling for OpenAI API failures
- Test response parsing for different AI response formats
- Test that prompts produce expected conventional commit formats
- Test rate limiting and timeout scenarios

### Acceptance Criteria

- Service generates meaningful commit messages for various diff types
- Responses follow conventional commit format consistently
- API errors are handled gracefully
- All functions are properly tested with mocks
- Service respects rate limits and handles timeouts
