## **Ticket 10: Core EC2 Infrastructure**

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

### **Description**

Create foundational AWS infrastructure for EC2-based application deployment with proper networking, security, and load balancing configured through Terraform.

### **Requirements**

- Create VPC with public subnets across 2 availability zones
- Deploy EC2 instance with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Configure public Application Load Balancer with health checks
- Set up security groups with minimal required access (SSH from specific IPs, HTTP/HTTPS from internet, application port from ALB only)
- Configure SSL/TLS certificate using AWS Certificate Manager with automatic validation
- Add basic CloudWatch monitoring for EC2 instance metrics
- Create Terraform outputs for integration with subsequent tickets
- Configure proper tagging strategy for all resources
- Set up Internet Gateway and route tables for public subnet connectivity

### **Files to Create**

- `infrastructure/main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration with provider settings
- `infrastructure/variables.tf` - Input variables with descriptions and defaults
- `infrastructure/outputs.tf` - Resource outputs for other tickets to reference
- `infrastructure/vpc.tf` - VPC, subnets, internet gateway, route tables
- `infrastructure/security-groups.tf` - Security group definitions for ALB and EC2
- `infrastructure/ec2.tf` - EC2 instance configuration with user data
- `infrastructure/alb.tf` - Application Load Balancer and target group setup
- `infrastructure/acm.tf` - SSL certificate configuration and validation
- `infrastructure/cloudwatch.tf` - Basic EC2 monitoring setup
- `infrastructure/user-data.sh` - EC2 initialization script for Node.js setup
- `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars.example` - Example variables file with placeholders

### **Infrastructure Specifications**

- **VPC:** CIDR block with sufficient IP space for future growth
- **Subnets:** Public subnets in 2 AZs for high availability
- **EC2 Instance:** t3.micro with 20GB gp3 EBS root volume
- **Load Balancer:** Application Load Balancer with HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- **Security:** Security groups following principle of least privilege
- **SSL:** ACM certificate with DNS validation for custom domain
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch basic monitoring enabled

### **Security Configuration**

- ALB security group allows HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from internet
- EC2 security group allows SSH from specific IP ranges only
- EC2 security group allows application port access from ALB security group only
- All other ports blocked by default
- Security group rules documented with descriptions

### **Testing Requirements**

- Terraform plan shows expected resource creation without errors
- Terraform apply creates all resources successfully without manual intervention
- EC2 instance passes AWS status checks within 5 minutes
- ALB health checks pass after application deployment
- SSL certificate validates successfully and serves HTTPS traffic
- CloudWatch shows EC2 metrics (CPU, memory, network) within 5 minutes
- SSH access works from specified IP ranges using key pair
- Application accessible via ALB DNS name on both HTTP and HTTPS

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] All Terraform files pass validation and formatting checks
- [ ] Infrastructure estimated monthly cost under $15 for single instance
- [ ] EC2 instance accessible via SSH using specified key pair
- [ ] ALB successfully routes traffic to EC2 instance on application port
- [ ] SSL certificate auto-validates and serves valid HTTPS
- [ ] HTTP traffic automatically redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboard displays basic EC2 metrics
- [ ] Security groups implement least privilege access
- [ ] All resources properly tagged for organization and billing
- [ ] Terraform state file properly configured for team collaboration
