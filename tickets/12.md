## **Ticket 12: Deployment Automation & Process Management**

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

### **Description**

Implement comprehensive deployment automation with PM2 process management, Nginx reverse proxy configuration, and zero-downtime deployment capabilities for production reliability and operational excellence.

### **Requirements**

- Configure PM2 for clustered process management with automatic restarts
- Set up Nginx as reverse proxy with SSL termination and security headers
- Create deployment scripts for zero-downtime application updates
- Implement secure environment variable management for production
- Set up comprehensive log rotation and archival system
- Create automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Configure health check system for deployment verification
- Implement backup strategy for application code and configuration
- Set up monitoring for deployment success/failure metrics

### **Files to Create**

- `ecosystem.config.js` - PM2 configuration with clustering and restart policies
- `nginx.conf` - Nginx reverse proxy with security and performance optimization
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Zero-downtime deployment script with health checks
- `scripts/setup-server.sh` - Initial server setup script with all dependencies
- `scripts/rollback.sh` - Automated rollback script to previous version
- `scripts/health-check.sh` - Comprehensive application health verification
- `.env.production.example` - Production environment variables template
- `scripts/backup-config.sh` - Configuration and application backup script
- `logrotate.conf` - Log rotation configuration for application and system logs
- `scripts/monitoring-setup.sh` - Script to configure additional monitoring tools

### **Process Management Configuration**

- PM2 cluster mode for public application with multiple instances
- PM2 single instance for internal application to avoid port conflicts
- Automatic restart policies with exponential backoff for failed restarts
- Memory limits and automatic restart on memory threshold breach
- Comprehensive logging with timestamped entries
- Process monitoring with CPU and memory usage tracking
- Graceful shutdown handling for zero-downtime deployments

### **Nginx Configuration Requirements**

- Reverse proxy configuration for both public and internal applications
- SSL/TLS termination with modern cipher suites and protocols
- Security headers implementation (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Gzip compression for improved performance
- Static file serving with appropriate caching headers
- Custom error pages for better user experience
- Access logging with detailed request information
- Explicit blocking of internal routes from public access

### **Deployment Process Requirements**

- Pre-deployment backup of current application version
- Dependency installation and build process execution
- Database migration execution (if applicable)
- Configuration file validation before deployment
- Gradual instance restart to maintain service availability
- Post-deployment health check verification for all endpoints
- Automatic rollback trigger on health check failures
- Notification system for deployment status (success/failure)
- Deployment metrics collection for monitoring

### **Environment and Security Management**

- Secure storage and loading of environment variables
- Separation of sensitive configuration from application code
- Encryption of sensitive configuration values at rest
- Proper file permissions for configuration files
- Regular backup of configuration and environment files
- Audit logging for configuration changes
- Validation of required environment variables on startup

### **Logging and Monitoring Setup**

- Application log rotation with size and time-based policies
- System log aggregation and archival
- Error log monitoring with alert triggers
- Performance log analysis for optimization opportunities
- Security log monitoring for intrusion detection
- Log retention policies compliant with business requirements
- Centralized logging with proper indexing for searchability

### **Testing Requirements**

- PM2 successfully starts application with configured clustering
- Nginx properly routes traffic to application instances with load balancing
- Zero-downtime deployment completes without service interruption
- Health checks pass during entire deployment process
- Rollback script restores previous version within specified time limit
- Log rotation prevents disk space exhaustion
- Application automatically restarts on crashes within acceptable timeframe
- Environment variables properly loaded and accessible in production
- All security headers present in HTTP responses
- Internal routes properly blocked from public access

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Deployment script performs zero-downtime updates successfully
- [ ] PM2 shows configured number of clustered instances for public application
- [ ] Nginx serves HTTPS traffic with all required security headers
- [ ] Internal routes return 403 when accessed via public interface
- [ ] Application automatically restarts on crashes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Rollback script tested and completes within 60 seconds
- [ ] Log rotation configured and prevents disk space issues
- [ ] Health checks verify both public and internal endpoints during deployment
- [ ] Environment variables securely managed and properly loaded
- [ ] Deployment completes end-to-end within 3 minutes
- [ ] All security measures validated and operational
- [ ] Monitoring confirms zero service interruption during deployment
