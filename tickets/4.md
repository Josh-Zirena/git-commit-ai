## Ticket 4: Express Server and API Endpoint

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### Description

Create the main Express server with the API endpoint that processes git diffs and returns generated commit messages. Include middleware for security and rate limiting.

### Requirements

- Set up Express server with TypeScript
- Implement CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Add rate limiting (10 requests per minute)
- Create POST endpoint `/api/generate-commit` that accepts git diffs
- Integrate validation utilities and OpenAI service
- Implement proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- Add request logging for debugging
- Serve static files from public directory

### Files to Create

- `src/index.ts` with main Express server
- `test/index.test.ts` with API endpoint tests

### Testing Requirements

- Test successful commit message generation via API
- Test input validation through the API endpoint
- Test rate limiting behavior
- Test error handling for various failure scenarios
- Test CORS headers are properly set
- Test static file serving
- Integration tests with mocked OpenAI service

### Acceptance Criteria

- API endpoint accepts valid git diffs and returns commit messages
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (10 requests per minute)
- Input validation rejects invalid diffs
- Error responses include helpful messages
- CORS is properly configured
- All tests pass including integration tests
