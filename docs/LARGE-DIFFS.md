# Handling Extremely Large Git Diffs

This document explains how the AI Git Commit Generator handles extremely large git diffs and provides strategies for dealing with them effectively.

## Problem Statement

Large git diffs present several challenges:

1. **Memory consumption** - Large diffs can consume significant RAM
2. **API token limits** - OpenAI models have context length limits (typically 8K-128K tokens)
3. **Processing time** - Large diffs take longer to analyze
4. **Cost implications** - More tokens = higher API costs
5. **Quality degradation** - Too much information can reduce commit message quality

## Current System Limits

### Standard Endpoint (`/api/generate-commit`)
- **Payload limit**: 10MB
- **Processing**: Direct processing, no optimization
- **Best for**: Regular-sized diffs (< 100KB)

### Enhanced Endpoint (`/api/generate-commit-enhanced`)
- **Payload limit**: 10MB
- **Processing**: Intelligent chunking and summarization
- **Best for**: Large diffs (100KB - 10MB)

## Processing Strategies

The system uses three different strategies based on diff size:

### 1. Direct Processing (< 50KB)
- Processes the diff as-is
- Fastest and most accurate
- No information loss

### 2. Chunked Processing (50KB - 5MB)
- Splits diff into individual file chunks
- Prioritizes files by importance
- Selects most important changes
- Provides summary of truncated files

### 3. Summarized Processing (> 5MB)
- Creates high-level summary
- Includes only critical file changes
- Focuses on overall intent
- Significant information reduction

## File Prioritization Algorithm

The system prioritizes files based on several factors:

### High Priority (+2 points)
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml` (dependency changes)
- `README`, `CHANGELOG` (documentation)
- Configuration files (`.config`, `Dockerfile`)
- Core source files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`)

### Medium Priority (Base: 3 points)
- Regular source files
- Standard modifications

### Low Priority (-1 to -2 points)
- Test files (`test/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/`, `.test.`)
- Generated files (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.min.`)
- Documentation files (unless critical)

### Change Size Modifiers
- **Large changes** (>100 lines): +1 point
- **Small changes** (<5 lines): -1 point
- **New/deleted files**: +1 point

## API Usage

### Enhanced Endpoint Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate-commit-enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "diff": "your-large-git-diff-here"
  }'
```

### Enhanced Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "commitMessage": "feat: implement user authentication system",
  "description": "Added comprehensive user authentication with JWT tokens, password hashing, and role-based access control across multiple components.",
  "summary": "Large-scale authentication implementation",
  "usage": {
    "promptTokens": 2450,
    "completionTokens": 85,
    "totalTokens": 2535
  },
  "processingInfo": {
    "originalSize": 2457600,
    "processedSize": 307200,
    "filesAnalyzed": 15,
    "totalFiles": 47,
    "wasTruncated": true,
    "processingStrategy": "chunked"
  }
}
```

### Processing Info Explanation

- **originalSize**: Size of the original diff in bytes
- **processedSize**: Size after processing/chunking
- **filesAnalyzed**: Number of files included in the analysis
- **totalFiles**: Total number of files in the original diff
- **wasTruncated**: Whether some content was omitted
- **processingStrategy**: Which strategy was used

## Best Practices for Large Diffs

### For Developers

1. **Split Large Changes**
   ```bash
   # Instead of one massive commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "huge refactor"
   
   # Break into logical chunks
   git add src/auth/
   git commit -m "feat: add authentication module"
   
   git add src/api/
   git commit -m "feat: add API endpoints for auth"
   
   git add tests/
   git commit -m "test: add authentication tests"
   ```

2. **Use Staged Commits**
   ```bash
   # Add files incrementally
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "deps: update authentication dependencies"
   
   git add src/components/Login.tsx
   git commit -m "feat: add login component"
   ```

3. **Focus on Core Changes**
   ```bash
   # Exclude generated files and dependencies
   echo "dist/" >> .gitignore
   echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
   
   # Commit only source changes
   git add src/ docs/
   git commit
   ```

### For CI/CD Systems

1. **Configure Diff Limits**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions example
   - name: Generate commit message
     run: |
       DIFF_SIZE=$(git diff --cached | wc -c)
       if [ $DIFF_SIZE -gt 100000 ]; then
         echo "Using enhanced endpoint for large diff"
         ENDPOINT="/api/generate-commit-enhanced"
       else
         ENDPOINT="/api/generate-commit"
       fi
   ```

2. **Handle Timeouts**
   ```yaml
   - name: Generate commit with timeout
     timeout-minutes: 5
     run: |
       curl --max-time 300 -X POST $ENDPOINT \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d "$(jq -n --arg diff "$(git diff --cached)" '{diff: $diff}')"
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Client-Side Preprocessing

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-filter large diffs on client side

DIFF=$(git diff --cached)
DIFF_SIZE=$(echo "$DIFF" | wc -c)

if [ $DIFF_SIZE -gt 1000000 ]; then
  echo "Diff is very large (${DIFF_SIZE} bytes). Consider splitting the commit."
  
  # Show summary
  git diff --cached --stat
  
  # Ask for confirmation
  read -p "Continue with large diff? (y/N) " -n 1 -r
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### Server-Side Caching

```typescript
// Example caching strategy
const diffCache = new Map<string, CommitResult>();

function getCacheKey(diff: string): string {
  return require('crypto')
    .createHash('sha256')
    .update(diff)
    .digest('hex')
    .substring(0, 16);
}

async function generateWithCache(diff: string) {
  const key = getCacheKey(diff);
  
  if (diffCache.has(key)) {
    return diffCache.get(key);
  }
  
  const result = await enhancedService.generateCommitMessage(diff);
  diffCache.set(key, result);
  
  return result;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Context Length Exceeded**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Git diff exceeds AI model context limits. Please split into smaller commits."
   }
   ```

2. **Processing Timeout**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Processing timeout. The diff is too complex to analyze."
   }
   ```

3. **Memory Exhaustion**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Server memory limit exceeded. Please reduce diff size."
   }
   ```

### Fallback Strategies

1. **Progressive Reduction**
   ```typescript
   async function generateWithFallback(diff: string) {
     const strategies = [
       { maxSize: 500000, summarize: false },
       { maxSize: 200000, summarize: true },
       { maxSize: 50000, summarize: true }
     ];
     
     for (const strategy of strategies) {
       try {
         const service = new EnhancedOpenAIService(strategy);
         return await service.generateCommitMessage(diff);
       } catch (error) {
         continue; // Try next strategy
       }
     }
     
     throw new Error('Unable to process diff with any strategy');
   }
   ```

2. **File-by-file Processing**
   ```typescript
   async function processFileByFile(diff: string) {
     const processor = new DiffProcessor();
     const processed = processor.processDiff(diff);
     
     const results = [];
     for (const chunk of processed.chunks.slice(0, 5)) {
       try {
         const result = await service.generateCommitMessage(chunk.content);
         results.push(`${chunk.filePath}: ${result.commitMessage}`);
       } catch (error) {
         results.push(`${chunk.filePath}: [processing failed]`);
       }
     }
     
     return {
       commitMessage: `feat: update ${processed.totalFiles} files`,
       description: results.join('\n'),
       summary: processed.summary
     };
   }
   ```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Processing Times**
   - By diff size
   - By processing strategy
   - By file count

2. **Success Rates**
   - By diff size ranges
   - By file types
   - By processing strategy

3. **Cost Analysis**
   - Token usage by diff size
   - API costs by strategy
   - Processing efficiency

4. **Quality Metrics**
   - User satisfaction with large diff commits
   - Manual override rates
   - Commit message accuracy

### Example Monitoring Dashboard

```typescript
interface ProcessingMetrics {
  diffSize: number;
  processingTime: number;
  strategy: string;
  tokenUsage: number;
  success: boolean;
  filesProcessed: number;
  truncated: boolean;
}

class MetricsCollector {
  logProcessing(metrics: ProcessingMetrics) {
    // Send to monitoring system
    console.log(`[METRICS] ${JSON.stringify(metrics)}`);
  }
}
```

```

## Conclusion

The enhanced large diff handling system provides multiple strategies to deal with extremely large git diffs while maintaining commit message quality and system performance. By using intelligent chunking, file prioritization, and adaptive processing strategies, the system can handle diffs from a few KB to several MB while providing meaningful commit messages.

For best results with large diffs:
1. Use the enhanced endpoint (`/api/generate-commit-enhanced`)
2. Consider splitting very large changes into logical commits
3. Monitor processing metrics to optimize performance
4. Configure appropriate timeouts and error handling
5. Use caching when possible to reduce costs

The system will continue to evolve with better algorithms and machine learning improvements to handle increasingly complex codebases and change patterns.
